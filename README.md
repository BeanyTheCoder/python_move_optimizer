# Move Optimizer Project üêæ

A simple function that calculates the resultant movement based on given cardinal directions (\***\*NORTH**, **SOUTH**, _EAST_, **WEST\*\***) and returns the simplified path.

## Original problem

### Direction Catastrophe

A very simple problem with many different solutions, but the main aim is to solve it in the most efficient way. A man was given directions to go from point A to point B. The directions were: "**SOUTH\*", "**NORTH*", "*WEST*", "*EAST*". Clearly "*NORTH*" and "*SOUTH*" are opposite, "*WEST*" and "*EAST\*" too. Going to one direction and coming back in the opposite direction is a waste of time and energy. So, we need to help the man by writing a program that will eliminate the useless steps and will contain only the necessary directions.

For example: The directions ["*NORTH*", "*SOUTH*", "*SOUTH*", "*EAST*", "*WEST*", "*NORTH*", "*WEST*"] should be reduced to ["*WEST*"]. This is because going "_NORTH_" and then immediately "_SOUTH_" means coming back to the same place. So we cancel them and we have ["*SOUTH*", "*EAST*", "*WEST*", "*NORTH*", "*WEST*"]. Next, we go "_SOUTH_", take "_EAST_" and then immediately take "_WEST_", which again means coming back to the same point. Hence we cancel "_EAST_" and "_WEST_" to giving us ["*SOUTH*", "*NORTH*", "*WEST*"]. It‚Äôs clear that "_SOUTH_" and "_NORTH_" are opposites hence canceled and finally we are left with ["*WEST*"].
